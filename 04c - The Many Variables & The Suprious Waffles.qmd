## Categorical Variables

A common question for statistical methods is to what extent an outcome changes as a result of presence or absence of a category. A category here means discrete and unordered. For example, consider the different species in the milk energy data again. Some of them are apes, while others are New World monkeys. We might want to ask how predictions should vary when the species is an ape instead of a monkey. Taxonomic group is a **categorical variable**, because no species can be half-ape and half-monkey (discreteness), and there is no sense in which one is larger or smaller than the other (unordered). Other common examples of categorical variables include:

-   Sex: male, female
-   Developmental status: infant, juvenile, adult
-   Geographic region: Africa, Europe, Melanesia
