## Random Processes

A "random process" is a _stochastic (as opposed to _deterministic) sequence of outcome-producing events/trials_.

An example is a series of coin flips.
It is _stochastic_, because we are unable to deterministically control
what the result of the coin flip (_event/trial_) is,
and over multiple coin flips (events/trial), we get back a sequence of heads and tails (outcomes).
