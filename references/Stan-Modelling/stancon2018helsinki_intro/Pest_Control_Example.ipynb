    "Imagine that you are a statistician or data scientist working as an independent contractor. One of your clients is a company that owns many residential buildings throughout New York City. The property manager explains that they are concerned about the number of cockroach complaints that they receive from their buildings. Previously the company has offered monthly visits from a pest inspector as a solution to this problem. While this is the default solution of many property managers in NYC, the tenants are rarely home when the inspector visits, and so the manager reasons that this is a relatively expensive solution that is currently not very effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative to this problem is to deploy long term bait stations. In this alternative, child and pet safe bait stations are installed throughout the apartment building. Cockroaches obtain quick acting poison from these stations and distribute it throughout the colony. The manufacturer of these bait stations provides some indication of the space-to-bait efficacy, but the manager suspects that this guidance was not calculated with NYC roaches in mind. NYC roaches, the manager rationalizes, have more hustle than traditional roaches; and NYC buildings are built differently than other common residential buildings in the US. This is particularly important as the unit cost for each bait station per year is quite high."

A common way of modeling this sort of skewed, single bounded count data is as a Poisson random variable. One concern about modeling the outcome variable as Poisson is that the data may be over-dispersed, but we'll start with the Poisson model and then check whether over-dispersion is a problem by comparing our model's predictions to the data."
