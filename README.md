# Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in Python and Stan (Second Edition)

Here is a yet another attempt to replicate (nearly) all models in Richard McElreathâ€™s Statistical Rethinking (2nd ed.) book using Python, Stan ([CmdStanPy](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanpy/)), [BridgeStan](https://roualdes.github.io/bridgestan/latest/), [ArviZ](https://python.arviz.org/en/stable/), and Matplotlib. *This is work in progress*.

## `StanQuap`

The first part of his book, McElreath utilizes his custom `quap` function from his [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) package. I have made an attempt to incorporate its behavior by creating a custom class [`StanQuap`](utils.py) using Stan and BridgeStan. The general outline of how `StanQuap` works is outlined below: 

- The Stan model passed as an argument is optimized using the CmdStanPy's `optimize()` API which computes the Maximum Likehood Estimate (MLE) or Maximum A Posteriori Estimate (MAP). 
- The class constructor passes the model, the data, and the unconstrained parameters from the MLE/MAP into BridgeStan's `log_density_hessian` which gives us the unconstrained hessian matrix.
- We compute the inverse of the unconstrained hessian matrix and then transform the unconstrained variance-covariance matrix into the constrained space using an analytical method (Jacobian Matrix).
- The parameter output and the variance covariance matrix can be used to samples from the posterior normal/multivariate normal distribution. 
- The methods: `laplace_sample`, `extract_samples`, `link`, and `sim` utilize CmdStanPy's `laplace_sample` API for its speed and robustness given its own parameter transformations.
