        "The **small world** is the self-contained logical world of the model. Within the small world , all possibilities are nominated. There are no pure surprises. Within the small world of the model, it is important to be able to verify the model’s logic, making sure that it performs as expected under favorable assumptions. Bayesian models have some advantages in this regard, as they have reasonable claims to optimality: No alternative model could make better use of the information in the data and support better decisions, assuming the small world is an accurate description of the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **large world** is the broader context in which one deploys a model. In the large world, there may be events that were not imagined in the small world. Moreover, the model is always an incomplete representation of the large world, and so will make mistakes, even if all kinds of events have been properly nominated. The logical consistency of a model in the small world is no guarantee that it will be optimal in the large world. But it is certainly a warm comfort.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we will begin to build Bayesian models. The way that Bayesian models learn from evidence is arguably optimal in the small world. When their assumptions approximate reality, they also perform well in the large world. But large world performance has to be demonstrated rather than logically deduced. Passing back and forth between these two worlds allows both formal methods, like Bayesian inference, and informal methods, like peer review, to play an indispensable role.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter focuses on the small world. It explains probability theory in its essential form: counting the ways things can happen. Bayesian inference arises automatically from this perspective. Then the chapter presents the stylized components of a Bayesian statistical model, a model for learning from data. Then it shows you how to animate the model, to produce estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Garden of Forking Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal in this section will be to build Bayesian inference up from humble beginnings, so there is no superstition about it. Bayesian inference is really just counting and comparing of possibilities. Consider by analogy Jorge Luis Borges’ short story “The Garden of Forking Paths.” The story is about a man who encounters a book filled with contradictions. In most books, characters arrive at plot points and must decide among alternative paths. A protagonist may arrive at a man’s home. She might kill the man, or rather take a cup of tea. Only one of these paths is taken—murder or tea. But the book within Borges’ story explores all paths, with each decision branching outward into an expanding garden of forking paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the same device that Bayesian inference offers. In order to make good inference about what actually happened, it helps to consider everything that could have happened. A Bayesian analysis is a garden of forking data, in which alternative sequences of events are cultivated. As we learn about what did happen, some of these alternative sequences are pruned. In the end, what remains is only what is logically consistent with our knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach provides a quantitative ranking of hypotheses, a ranking that is maximally conservative, given the assumptions and data that go into it. The approach cannot guarantee a correct answer, on large world terms. But it can guarantee the best possible answer, on small world terms, that could be derived from the information fed into it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following toy example.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Counting Possibilities\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose there’s a bag, and it contains four marbles. These marbles come in two colors: blue and white. We know there are four marbles in the bag, but we don’t know how many are of each color. We do know that there are five possibilities: (1) \\['W', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\], (2) \\['B', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\], (3) \\['B', 'B', 'W', 'W'\\], (4) \\['B', 'B', 'B', 'W'\\], (5) \\['B', 'B', 'B', 'B'\\]. These are the only possibilities consistent with what we know about the contents of the bag. Call these five possibilities the ***conjectures***.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to figure out which of these conjectures is most plausible, given some evidence about the contents of the bag. We do have some evidence: A sequence of three marbles is pulled from the bag, one at a time, replacing the marble each time and shaking the bag before drawing another marble. The sequence that emerges is: \\['B', 'W', 'B'\\], in that order. These are the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "So now let’s plant the garden and see how to use the data to infer what’s in the bag. Let’s begin by considering just the single conjecture, \\['B', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\], that the bag contains one blue and three white marbles. On the first draw from the bag, one of four things could happen, corresponding to one of four marbles in the bag. So we can visualize the possibilities branching outward:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](images/marble-conjecture-2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"170\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that even though the three white marbles look the same from a data perspective— we just record the color of the marbles, after all—they are really different events. This is important, because it means that there are three more ways to see W than to see B.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now consider the garden as we get another draw from the bag. It expands the garden out one layer:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](images/marble-tree-1.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"270\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "Now there are 16 possible paths through the garden, one for each pair of draws. On the second draw from the bag, each of the paths above again forks into four possible paths. Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because we believe that our shaking of the bag gives each marble a fair chance at being drawn, regardless of which marble was drawn previously. The third layer is built in the same way, and the full garden is shown below. There are $4^3 = 64$ possible paths in total.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](images/marble-tree-2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"270\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "As we consider each draw from the bag, some of these paths are logically eliminated. The first draw tuned out to be 'B', recall, so the three white paths at the bottom of the garden are eliminated right away. If you imagine the real data tracing out a path through the garden, it must have passed through the one blue path near the origin. The second draw from the bag produces 'W', so three of the paths forking out of the first blue marble remain. As the data trace out a path, we know it must have passed through one of those three white paths (after the first blue path), but we don’t know which one, because we recorded only the color of each marble. Finally, the third draw is 'B'. Each of the remaining three paths in the middle layer sustain one blue path, leaving a total of three ways for the sequence to appear, assuming the bag contains \\['B', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\].\n",

        "\n",
        "Figure above shows the garden again, now with logically eliminated paths grayed out. We can’t be sure which of those three paths the actual data took. But as long as we’re considering only the possibility that the bag contains one blue and three white marbles, we can be sure that the data took one of those three paths. Those are the only paths consistent with both our knowledge of the bag’s contents (four marbles, white or blue) and the data ('B', 'W', 'B').\n",
        "\n",
        "This demonstrates that there are three (out of 64) ways for a bag containing \\['B', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\] to produce the data . We have no way to decide among these three ways. The inferential power comes from comparing this count to the numbers of ways each of the other conjectures of the bag’s contents could produce the same data. For example, consider the conjecture \\['W', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\]. There are zero ways for this conjecture to produce the observed data, because even one is logically incompatible with it. The conjecture \\['B', 'B', 'B', 'B'\\] is likewise logically incompatible with the data. So we can eliminate these two conjectures, because neither provides even a single path that is consistent with the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The figure below displays the full garden now, for the remaining three conjectures: \\['B', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\], \\['B', 'B', 'W', 'W'\\], and \\['B', 'B', 'B', 'W'\\]. The upper-left wedge displays the same garden as earlier. The upper-right shows the analogous garden for the conjecture that the bag contains three blue marbles and one white marble. And the bottom wedge shows the garden for two blue and two white marbles. Now we count up all of the ways each conjecture could produce the observed data. For one blue and three white, there are three ways, as we counted already. For two blue and two white, there are eight paths forking through the garden that are logically consistent with the observed sequence. For three blue and one white, there are nine paths that survive.\n",

        "To summarize, we’ve considered five different conjectures about the contents of the bag, ranging from zero blue marbles to four blue marbles. For each of these conjectures, we’ve counted up how many sequences, paths through the garden of forking data, could potentially produce the observed data, ('B', 'W', 'B'):\n",

        "Notice that the number of ways to produce the data, for each conjecture, can be computed by first counting the number of paths in each “ring” of the garden and then by multiplying these counts together. This is just a computational device. It tells us the same thing as the figure above but without having to draw the garden. The fact that numbers are multiplied during calculation doesn’t change the fact that this is still just counting of logically possible paths. This point will come up again, when you meet a formal representation of Bayesian inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "So what good are these counts? By comparing these counts, we have part of a solution for a way to rate the relative plausibility of each conjectured bag composition. But it’s only a part of a solution, because in order to compare these counts we first have to decide *how many ways each conjecture could itself be realized.* We might argue that when we have no reason to assume otherwise, we can just consider *each conjecture equally plausible and compare the counts directly*. But often we do have reason to assume otherwise.\n",

        "### **Combining other information**\n",
        "\n",
        "We may have additional information about the relative plausibility of each conjecture. This information could arise from knowledge of how the contents of the bag were generated. It could also arise from previous data. Whatever the source, it would help to have a way to combine different sources of information to update the plausibilities. Luckily there is a natural solution: Just multiply the counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "To grasp this solution, suppose we’re willing to say each conjecture is equally plausible at the start. So we just compare the counts of ways in which each conjecture is compatible with the observed data. This comparison suggests that \\['B', 'B', 'B', 'W'\\] is slightly more plausible than \\['B', 'B', 'W', 'W'\\], and both are about three times more plausible than \\['B', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\]. Since these are our initial counts, and we are going to update them next, let’s label them *priors*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now suppose we draw another marble from the bag to get another observation: 'B'. Now you have two choices. You could start all over again, making a garden with four layers to trace out the paths compatible with the data sequence \\['B', 'W', 'B', 'B'\\]. Or you could take the previous counts—the prior counts—over conjectures (0, 3, 8, 9, 0) and just update them in light of the new observation. It turns out that these two methods are mathematically identical, as long as the *new observation is logically independent of the previous observations*.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The new counts in the right-hand column above summarize all the evidence for each conjecture. As new data arrive, and provided those data are independent of previous observations, then the number of logically possible ways for a conjecture to produce all the data up to that point can be computed just by multiplying the new count by the old count.\n",
        "\n",
        "This updating approach amounts to nothing more than asserting that (1) when we have previous information suggesting there are $W_{prior}$ ways for a conjecture to produce a previous observation $D_{prior}$ and (2) we acquire new observation $D_{new}$ that the same conjecture can produce in $W_{new}$ ways, then (3) the number of ways the conjecture can account for both $D_{prior}$ as well as $D_{new}$ is just product of $W_{prior} \\times W_{new}$. For example, in the table above the conjecture \\['B', 'B', 'W', 'W'\\] has $W_{prior}=8$ ways to produce $D_{prior}=$\\['B', 'W', 'B'\\]. It also has $W_{new} = 2$ ways to produce the new observation $D_{new}=$ 'B'.So there are $8 \\times 2 = 16$ ways for the conjecture to produce both $D_{prior}$ and $D_{new}$. Why multiply? Multiplication is just a shortcut to enumerating and counting up all of the paths through the garden that could produce all the observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the prior data and new data are of the same type: marbles drawn from the bag. But in general, the prior data and new data can be of different types. Suppose for example that someone from the marble factory tells you that blue marbles are rare. So for every bag containing \\['B', 'B', 'B', 'W'\\], they made two bags containing \\['B', 'B', 'W', 'W'\\] and three bags containing \\['B', 'W', 'W', 'W'\\]. They also ensured that every bag contained at least one blue and one white marble. We can update our counts again:\n",

Compute Total Ways: - The product of all values in `ways` represents the total ways to produce the observation sequence. This is calculated in log space (`np.log`) to improve numerical stability, especially for large values. - `np.exp` and `np.round` convert the log product back to the total count. 4. Compute Water Proportion: - `p_water` is the proportion of water sides on the globe, calculated as the count of `'W'` divided by the total sides.\n",

Call `plausibility_count`: - Computes `n_ways` (ways to produce the observations) and `p_water` (water proportion) for each configuration. 4. Store Results: - Append `n_ways` and `p_water` to their respective lists. 5. Print Results: - Prints the globe configuration, water proportion, and ways to produce the observations.\n"

After seeing the first toss, which is a “W”, the model updates the plausibilities to the solid line. The plausibility of $p=0$ has now fallen to exactly zero—the equivalent of “impossible.” Why? Because we observed at least one speck of water on the globe, so now we know there is some water. The model executes this logic automatically. You don’t have it instruct it to account for this consequence. Probability theory takes care of it for you, because it is essentially counting paths through the garden of forking data.\n",

This is because there is not yet any evidence that there is land on the globe, so the initial plausibilities are modified to be consistent with this. Note however that the relative plausibilities are what matter, and there isn’t yet much evidence. So the differences in plausibility are not yet very large. In this way, the amount of evidence seen so far is embodied in the plausibilities of each value of $p$.\n",

As each new observation is added, the curve is updated consistent with all previous observations.\n",

For every unique combination of data, likelihood, parameters, and prior, there is a unique posterior distribution. This distribution contains the relative plausibility of different parameter values, conditional on the data and model. The posterior distribution takes the form of the probability of the parameters, conditional on the data. In this case, it would be $Pr(p \\mid W,L)$, the probability of each possible value of $p$, conditional on the specific W and L that we observed.\n",

We’d like to avoid forced modeling choices of this kind, instead favoring conditioning engines that can accommodate whichever prior is most useful for inference.\n",

While most parameters are continuous, capable of taking on an infinite number of values, it turns out that we can achieve an excellent approximation of the continuous posterior distribution by considering only a finite grid of parameter values. At any particular value of a parameter, $p'$, it’s a simple matter to compute the posterior probability: just multiply the prior probability of $p'$ by the likelihood at $p'$. Repeating this procedure for each value in the grid generates an approximate picture of the exact posterior distribution. This procedure is called **grid approximation**.\n",

        "We’ll stick with the grid approximation to the globe tossing posterior, for the first few exercises. But before long you’ll have to resort to another approximation, one that makes stronger assumptions. The reason is that the number of unique values to consider in the grid grows rapidly as the number of parameters in your model increases. For the single-parameter globe tossing model, it’s no problem to compute a grid of 100 or 1000 values. But for two parameters approximated by 100 values each, that’s already $100^{2} =10,000$ values to compute. For 10 parameters, the grid becomes many billions of values. These days, it’s routine to have models with hundreds or thousands of parameters. The grid approximation strategy scales very poorly with model complexity, so it won’t get us very far.\n",
        "\n",
        "A useful approach is **quadratic approximation**. Under quite general conditions, the region near the peak of the posterior distribution will be nearly Gaussian—or “normal”—in shape. This means the posterior distribution can be usefully approximated by a Gaussian distribution. A Gaussian distribution is convenient, because it can be completely described by only two numbers: the location of its center (**mean**) and its spread (**variance**).\n",
        "\n",

        "For many of the most common procedures in applied statistics—linear regression, for example—the approximation works very well. Often, it is even exactly correct, not actually an approximation at all. Computationally, quadratic approximation is very inexpensive, at least compared to grid approximation and MCMC (discussed next). The procedure contains two steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "1)  Find the posterior mode. This is usually accomplished by some optimization algorithm, a procedure that virtually “climbs” the posterior distribution, as if it were a mountain.

But all of them try to find peaks.\n",

This curvature is sufficient to compute a quadratic approximation of the entire posterior distribution.

        "A Hessian is a square matrix of second derivatives. It is used for many purposes in mathematics, but in the quadratic approximation it is second derivatives of the log of posterior probability with respect to the parameters. It turns out that these derivatives are sufficient to describe a Gaussian distribution, because the logarithm of a Gaussian distribution is just a parabola. Parabolas have no derivatives beyond the second, so once we know the center of the parabola (the posterior mode) and its second derivative, we know everything about it. And indeed the second derivative (with respect to the outcome) of the logarithm of a Gaussian distribution is proportional to its **inverse squared standard deviation** (its “precision”). So knowing the standard deviation tells us everything about its shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard deviation is typically computed from the Hessian, so computing the Hessian is nearly always a necessary step. For now it’s enough to recognize the term and associate it with an attempt to find the standard deviation for a quadratic approximation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have presented a brief summary of the quadratic approximation. In this case, it shows the posterior mean value of p =0.67, which it calls the “Mean.” The curvature is labeled “StdDev” This stands for standard deviation. This value is the standard deviation of the posterior distribution, while the mean value is its peak. Finally, the last two values in the output show the 89% percentile interval, which you’ll learn more about later. You can read this kind of approximation like: *Assuming the posterior is Gaussian, it is maximized at 0.67, and its standard deviation is 0.16*.\n",

        "Accuracy of the quadratic approximation. In each plot, the exact posterior distribution is plotted in solid curve, and the quadratic approximation is plotted as the dotted curve. Left: The globe tossing data with $n=9$ tosses and $w=6$ waters. Middle: Double the amount of data, with the same fraction of water, $n=18$ and $w=12$. Right: Four times as much data, $n=36$ and $w=24$.\n",
        "\n",

In the middle plot, the sample size is doubled to $n =18$ tosses, but with the same fraction of water, so that the mode of the posterior is in the same place. The quadratic approximation looks better now, although still not great. At quadruple the data, on the right side of the figure, the two curves are nearly the same now.\n",
        "\n",
        "This phenomenon, where the quadratic approximation improves with the amount of data, is very common. It’s one of the reasons that so many classical statistical procedures are nervous about small samples: Those procedures use quadratic (or other) approximations that are only known to be safe with infinite data. Often, these approximations are useful with less than infinite data, obviously. But the rate of improvement as sample size increases varies greatly depending upon the details. In some models, the quadratic approximation can remain terrible even with thousands of samples.\n",

But you can always lean on some algorithm other than quadratic approximation, if you have doubts.

        "The quadratic approximation, either with a uniform prior or with a lot of data, is often equivalent to a **maximum likelihood estimate** (MLE) and its **standard error**. The MLE is a very common non-Bayesian parameter estimate. This correspondence between a Bayesian approximation and a common non-Bayesian estimator is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing, because it allows us to reinterpret a wide range of published non-Bayesian model fits in Bayesian terms. It is a curse, because maximum likelihood estimates have some curious drawbacks, and the quadratic approximation can share them. We’ll explore these drawbacks later, they are one of the reasons we’ll turn to Markov chain Monte Carlo.\n",

        "There are lots of important model types, like multilevel (mixed-effects) models, for which neither grid approximation nor quadratic approximation is always satisfactory. Such models may have hundreds or thousands or tens-of-thousands of parameters. Grid approximation routinely fails here, because it just takes too long. Special forms of quadratic approximation might work, if everything is just right. But commonly, something is not just right. Furthermore, multilevel models do not always allow us to write down a single, unified function for the posterior distribution. This means that the function to maximize (when finding the MAP) is not known, but must be computed in pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, various counterintuitive model fitting techniques have arisen. The most popular of these is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which is a family of conditioning engines capable of handling highly complex models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The conceptual challenge with MCMC lies in its highly non-obvious strategy. Instead of attempting to compute or approximate the posterior distribution directly, MCMC techniques merely draw samples from the posterior. You end up with a collection of parameter values,and the frequencies of these values correspond to the posterior plausibilities. You can then build a picture of the posterior from the histogram of these samples.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Outcome**: - The algorithm generates a sequence of 1000 samples (`p`) that approximate the posterior distribution of the probability parameter $p$. - Over many iterations, the chain will converge to the posterior distribution of $p$, allowing statistical inference about the probability of success given the observed data ($W = 6$, $L = 3$).\n",
